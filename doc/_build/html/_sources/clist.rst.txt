Command Line Interface
----------------------

Pulling data from JAO and ENTSOE-Transparency can be quite slow. The data is cached locally in the `~\.linearisation_error` directory.
You can pre download the data to disk using the CLIs `fetch_jao_data` and `fetch_entsoe_data`. Both of these accept a from-date and to-date,
on the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
