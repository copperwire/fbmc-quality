API keys
--------

To query data from `ENTSOE-Transparency <https://transparency.entsoe.eu/>`_ you need an API key from them. The `Transparency website has a guide <https://transparency.entsoe.eu/content/static_content/download?path=/Static%20content/API-Token-Management.pdf>`_.

The API key needs to be set in the environment before querying data, the value should be stored in :code:`ENTSOE_API_KEY`
